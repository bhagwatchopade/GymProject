            <h1>OUR STORY</h1>
            <p>gym and Fitness was founded in 2002 as a family owned and operated
                 business specialising in supplying high-quality gym equipment at great prices.</p>
                 <p><br>
                    Instead of being just another gym equipment retailer, our founders

                    Over the last two decades Gym and Fitness has grown into one of Australia’s 
                    largest online fitness equipment retailers, helping thousands of customers 
                    live longer, happier and healthier lives.
